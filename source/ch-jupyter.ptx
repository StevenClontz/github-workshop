In <xref ref="sec-run-code"/> you wrote and ran a few short
scripts in various programming languages. But often, we want
to not only be able to write and execute code, but do so
piece-by-piece, and share the results with other people
without requiring them to run the code themselves...

A <term>Jupyter notebook</term> is a file that stores
commentary, code, and output in an all-in-one format suitable for
sharing with other people.

Jupyter is a popular open-source tool used in
data science, scientific computing, and computational journalism.
GitHub provides a Codespace ready for running Jupyter notebooks
out of the box:
<url href="https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyter/"/>.

    <title>GitHub's Jupyter Codespace</title>
    <p>
Let's begin by going to
<url href="https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyter/">
  github/codespaces-jupyter</url>
directly. Before we dive into editing a notebook ourselves,
we can first browse the <c>notebooks</c> directory on
the repository page. We see three files, each with the
extension <c>*.ipynb</c>
(short for <q><em>IPY</em>thon <em>N</em>ote<em>B</em>ook</q>,
Jupyter's original name).
    </p>
    <p>
Clicking on each file, you'll note that while there's code,
most of the file is actually narrative and visualization.
That's the appeal of Jupyter for many people: it's about
communicating <em>stories</em>, not just data or software.
    </p>
    <p>
Additionally, you'll see a <c>data</c> directory, which
includes a <c>*.csv</c> <em>C</em>omma <em>S</em>eparated
<em>V</em>alues spreadsheet. This file can be read into a
notebook for analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
Now, let's follow the instructions of the repository's
README file (<xref ref="remark-readme"/>).

      To get started, create a Codespace
      (<xref ref="note-create-codespace"/>)
      on either an existing or new repository
      (<xref ref="sec-creating-the-repo"/>).
      You can then create a Jupyter notebook file named
      <c>notebook.ipynb</c>.
          </p>
          <note xml:id="note-provision-notebook">
            <p>
      In a Codespace, any file with the extension 
      will be treated as a
      Jupyter notebook. When opening this file, you'll see a notebook
      interface, and be prompted to
      <q>install the recommended 'Python' extension</q> if it's
      not already enabled - do this.
            </p>
            <p>
      Then in your notebook file, click the <q>Select Kernel</q>
      button, then <q>Install/Enable suggested extensions</q> for
      Python+Jupyter. You should then have the option to select
      a <q>Python environment</q> such as <c>Python 3.*.*</c>.
            </p>
            <p>
      If successful, you should be able to enter
      <c>import sys; print(sys.version)</c> into the displayed
      text box,
      and see the result of executing it with
      <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
            </p>
          </note>
          <p>
      There are plenty of existing tutorials on the internet to help you
      get acquainted with Python and Jupyter now that you have them
      available to you in your Codespace. But to get you started, I've provided
      one <dataurl source="first-notebook.ipynb">sample notebook</dataurl>
      that you can upload to your Codespace to break the ice.
